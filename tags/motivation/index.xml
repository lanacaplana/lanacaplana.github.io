It includes&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>setting objectives,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>providing feedback,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>improving performance,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>supporting learning and development,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>recognizing achievements, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>managing career growth.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When done effectively, performance management helps team members perform at their best, maximize their contributions, and continue learning and growing. It also plays a key role in motivation and engagement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Effective performance management enables managers to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Align their team’s efforts with organizational goals;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support team members in developing their skills, knowledge, and experience;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identify and address underperformance fairly and promptly;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recognize and reward strong performance;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set clear expectations for performance.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These benefits contribute to team &lt;a href="https://gracefulhr.com/post/engagement-what/">engagement&lt;/a>, motivation, and a positive work culture.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is employee engagement</title><link>https://gracefulhr.com/post/engagement-what/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gracefulhr.com/post/engagement-what/</guid><description>This post provides definitions of employee and work engagement.
