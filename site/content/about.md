### Who I am

Hi there, it's great to meet you! I'm Svitlana Orlova—a Global HR professional passionate about helping managers lead with empathy, clarity, and purpose.

Here’s a bit more about me:

Senior HR Business Partner in Tech (SaaS)
ICF-Certified Professional Coach
Associate Member of CIPD
Leadership Development Expert
Business Trainer

I’m here to support growth—for people, teams, and businesses.


### What I do

I believe the success of any business ultimately comes down to the quality of relationships between leaders and their teams. That’s why I partner with business leaders to tackle people challenges, recommend relevant models and tools, and support them in becoming outstanding leaders.

I equip managers with practical tools to boost team performance and reach personal and business goals—through Executive, Business, and Leadership Coaching, as well as Leadership Development Consulting and Training.

With 100+ hours of coaching experience aligned with International Coaching Federation (ICF) standards, and a solid background in HR and project management, I help managers unlock their leadership potential and achieve career, financial, and business success.

I believe great leadership means both inspiring as a leader and thriving as a person.

Having experience at both strategic and operational levels, I serve as a reliable partner in professional growth, business success, and team performance.


### What to expect

As an Executive Coach and Leadership Expert, I help managers boost team performance and achieve both personal and business goals.

Here’s how we can work together:

Coaching – A series of 12+ sessions to grow as a leader
Leadership Training – Tailored workshops to develop essential leadership skills
Career Mentorship – Personalized support for career growth
Lectures – Practical insights into people management tools and practices

Through coaching, you’ll learn how to:

Strengthen your influence with your team, peers, and leadership
Motivate and engage your (remote) team to drive real results
Delegate effectively for maximum impact
Plan and deliver projects on time
Set boundaries and say “no” without damaging relationships
Boost your energy, focus, and mental well-being

Let’s unlock your leadership potential—together!
