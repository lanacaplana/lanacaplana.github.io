### The impact of engagement on performance  

Employees who feel **valued and supported** are happier, healthier, and more engaged in their work. They are also more productive, deliver higher-quality results, and drive innovation.  

Research supports this:  
- **High employee engagement boosts company profitability by 21% and productivity by 17%** (Gallup).  
- It also improves **product quality, service, and innovation** (CIPD).  
- But engagement isn’t just about individual motivation—**70% of a team’s engagement level depends on its leader** (Gallup).  

So, what can managers do to create an environment where employees thrive?  

### Leadership behaviors that drive engagement  

In my experience as an HR Business Partner at the **United Nations** and in the **tech sector**, I’ve worked with many outstanding leaders and high-performing teams. Each organization tailors its leadership approach to its goals and culture.  

For example:  
- At **UNOPS**, leadership principles emphasize **fairness, respect, and ethical decision-making**.  
- At **airSlate**, the focus is on **motivating teams, driving business impact, and leading change**.  

Despite these differences, the most successful leaders share one common trait: **they foster strong engagement through clear communication, trust, and development opportunities**.  

### What does research say about leadership and engagement?  

Several studies highlight key leadership behaviors that enhance engagement:  
- [**Gartner**](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/the-3-qualities-you-need-to-be-a-really-effective-leader): Authenticity, empathy, and adaptability.  
- [**Harvard Business Review**](https://hbr.org/2017/06/how-managers-drive-results-and-employee-engagement-at-the-same-time): Clear communication, inspiration, ambitious goal-setting, integrity, coaching, and personal development.  
- [**BetterUp**](https://www.betterup.com/blog/whole-person-model-to-build-inspiring-leaders-thriving-teams): A balance of **thriving behaviors** (e.g., emotional regulation, focus, and well-being) and **inspiring behaviors** (e.g., motivation, inclusion, and guidance).  

While leadership styles vary, [**CIPD research**](https://www.cipd.org/uk/knowledge/tools/line-manager-introduction-to-support-materials/) identifies five key managerial behaviors that consistently enhance engagement, well-being, and performance. Interestingly, these behaviors also align with **core coaching principles**.
