Performance management is a **core responsibility of every leader**. A strong approach not only supports individual growth but also builds team cohesion and strengthens an organization’s ability to deliver results. Yet, in many companies, performance management becomes so overengineered that managers end up spending tens of hours on it, usually at year-end when business deadlines are already piling up.

### The challenge  
Managers need a way to make performance management effective without it turning into a time-consuming burden.

### The solution  
Regular, structured conversations. A simple 1-on-1, scheduled in your calendar, is the most powerful tool you can use. Ideally, aim for a weekly 30-minute discussion with each team member. Gallup’s research shows that 15–30 minutes is enough for a meaningful conversation, but only if it happens frequently.

## What to focus on  

The most impactful discussions focus on **employee strengths** - the things they do well. When managers anchor conversations in what people naturally excel at, they can better explore how each person gets their work done and how to build on those strengths.

John Doerr, in *Measure What Matters*, highlights the **CFR framework** for performance management: **Conversations, Feedback, Recognition**. Below is a practical way to apply it in your 1-on-1s.

### 1. Goal planning & reflection  

**When:** Start of cycle / quarterly planning  
**Why:** Align OKRs with company priorities, clarify expectations early, focus on impact not activity  
**How:** Ask questions like:  
- What OKRs will create the greatest value?  
- Which OKRs align with key initiatives?  
- What excites you most about your goals?  


### 2. Progress updates  

**When:** Monthly or mid-cycle  
**Why:** Normalize regular status reviews, address blockers early, encourage adaptability  
**How:** Ask questions like:  
- How are your OKRs progressing?  
- What’s helping or hindering your work?  
- Do we need to adjust or shift priorities?  


### 3. Recognition  

**When:** Regularly, upon merit  
**Why:** Recognition reinforces motivation and engagement  
**How:**  
- Say thank you, even for small wins  
- Write personal notes to show you care  
- Share success stories in meetings or emails  
- Listen to your team’s ideas and feedback  
- Give awards or bonuses for bigger achievements  


### 4. Feedback  

**When:** Regularly, when reviewing achievements and challenges  
**Why:** Foster both professional and personal growth  
**How:** Use the **SBI-E model**  
- **Situation:** Describe the context  
- **Behavior:** Specify the actions you observed  
- **Impact:** Explain the consequences of the behavior  
- **Expectations:** Reinforce the desired behavior and link it to team success  


Performance management doesn’t have to be complex. With regular, focused conversations, you can transform it from a bureaucratic task into a meaningful leadership tool. And remember - managers also need support. As Gallup notes, everyone benefits from weekly meaningful conversations, including leaders themselves.


## Main takeaways  

1. Performance management works best when it’s simple and built on regular 1-on-1s.  
2. Weekly 15–30 minute conversations are more effective than lengthy annual reviews.  
3. Focus discussions on strengths, goals, progress, recognition, and feedback.  
4. Use frameworks like CFR and SBI-E to structure conversations.  
5. Great managers not only give feedback and recognition but also seek support from their own leaders.
