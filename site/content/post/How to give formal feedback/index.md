### Why formal feedback matters

Feedback is one of the most powerful tools a manager has to drive growth, alignment, and team success. Yet, many leaders hesitate to give it, fearing they will demotivate employees or create tension. In reality, feedback—when done correctly—not only helps team members improve but also strengthens trust and engagement. The key lies in delivering feedback that is **specific, objective**, and **actionable**, rather than vague or personal.

A structured approach, such as the **Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI)** model, ensures that feedback is delivered in a way that employees can understand and act on. But before jumping into the feedback itself, one crucial step is often overlooked: **setting clear expectations**.

### Laying the groundwork: setting clear expectations

Feedback is most effective when it is anchored in predefined expectations. Employees need to understand what is expected of them before they can be held accountable. Expectations can come in different forms:

- Job descriptions that outline responsibilities and key performance indicators.
- Company policies and procedures that define behavioral and operational standards.
- Team agreements and cultural values that shape collaboration and communication norms.
- Specific performance goals that set targets for individual and team success.

When expectations are clear, feedback becomes less about personal opinions and more about aligning performance with agreed-upon standards. If an employee's behavior deviates from these expectations, the SBI model can help guide the conversation.

### How to use the SBI model effectively

The Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) model provides a straightforward framework for structuring feedback conversations:

**Situation (S)**: Start by describing the context where the behavior occurred. Be specific to help the employee recall the moment.
  - Example: "During last Monday’s project review meeting…"
**Behavior (B)**: Describe the specific actions or behaviors you observed, without making assumptions or personal judgments.
  - Example: "You interrupted colleagues multiple times before they could finish their points."
**Impact (I)**: Explain the consequences of the behavior and how it affects the team or goals.
  - Example: "This made it difficult for others to share their ideas and slowed down our decision-making process."

To ensure feedback leads to meaningful change, add a final step:

**Expectations (E)**: Reinforce the desired behavior and align it with team success.
  - Example: "In future meetings, I’d like you to allow others to finish speaking before responding. This will help create a more open and collaborative discussion."

### Putting it all together

Imagine a team member who frequently misses deadlines without prior communication. Using the SBI+E approach, the conversation might go like this:

**Situation**: "For the last two project sprints, your reports were submitted two days late."

**Behavior**: "You didn’t notify the team in advance that you were behind schedule."

**Impact**: "This caused delays in the overall project timeline and created additional stress for the team."

**Expectation**: "Going forward, if you anticipate a delay, please communicate it in advance so we can adjust plans accordingly."

This structured approach removes ambiguity, makes feedback feel less personal, and provides a clear path for improvement.

### Main takeaways

- **Effective feedback** starts with clear expectations so employees understand what success looks like.
- The **SBI model** ensures feedback is structured, objective, and actionable.
- Adding an **Expectation (E)** step reinforces positive change and aligns behavior with team goals.
- **Feedback** should be a regular practice, not just a formal review process.
- When delivered correctly, feedback builds trust, fosters growth, and enhances team collaboration.
