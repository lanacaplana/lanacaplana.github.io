Performance management doesn’t have a single definition. It includes

* setting objectives, 
* providing feedback, 
* improving performance, 
* supporting learning and development,
* recognizing achievements, and 
* managing career growth. 

When done effectively, performance management helps team members perform at their best, maximize their contributions, and continue learning and growing. It also plays a key role in motivation and engagement.

Effective performance management enables managers to:

* Align their team’s efforts with organizational goals;
* Support team members in developing their skills, knowledge, and experience;
* Identify and address underperformance fairly and promptly;
* Recognize and reward strong performance;
* Set clear expectations for performance.

These benefits contribute to team [engagement](https://gracefulhr.com/post/engagement-what/), motivation, and a positive work culture.
